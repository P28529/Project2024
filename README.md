 Quiz Game
 

The God of War Quiz is an interactive web-based quiz inspired by the mythology and themes from the legendary God of War series. This project features questions spanning Greek and Norse mythology, combined with visually engaging elements like a looping thematic background video, question-specific images, and a dynamic interface. Designed for fans of the series and mythology enthusiasts alike, the quiz tests your knowledge while providing an immersive experience with its responsive design and timed gameplay.

The project consists of three main files: `index.html`, which structures the quiz interface; `styles.css`, which ensures a visually appealing and responsive design; and `script.js`, which powers the logic for displaying questions, handling the timer, and managing user interactions. The quiz dynamically updates with images and questions, ensuring an engaging user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Some of the assets, such as the background video and question-specific images, are sourced from publicly available media, and credit goes to their respective creators. Additionally, I utilized ChatGPT to assist in the development of certain code sections and the overall project structure, which helped streamline the process.

To run the quiz, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. Contributions are welcome, and anyone can fork the repository or raise issues to improve and expand the project further.
